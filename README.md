**Functioning:**
The application allows the player to control a waitress within a restaurant. The player's goal is to serve as many customers as possible by seating them, taking orders and serving them. When the meal is finished, a customer or group of customers pays, and the player's total earnings increase. Some PowerUp can be activated during the game to modify in-game certain game dynamics.
