**INSTRUCTIONS:**\
The application allows the player to control a waitress within a restaurant. The player's goal is to serve as many customers as possible by seating them, taking orders and serving them. When the meal is finished, a customer or group of customers pays, and the player's total earnings increase. Some PowerUp can be activated during the game to modify in-game certain game dynamics.

**COMMANDS:**\
Program inputs consist of mouse clicks. It is possible to select objects or menu buttons.

- **Table**: clicking on a table, the waitress will reach it and, if necessary, collect orders, serve food or charge customers.
- **Plate**: when a dish is ready it will appear on the counter top. By clicking on it, the waitress will reach out to get it.
